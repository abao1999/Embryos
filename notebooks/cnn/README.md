# Basic CNN Models

This folder contains our work on image classification with basic from-scratch CNN models. Here is an overview of the files:
1. `classify_fluo_CNN_torch_drive.ipynb` - Pytorch implementation of CNN taking 2D images with single time step and single z aggregation
2. `classify_fluo_CNN_torch_drive_2.ipynb` - Same as `classify_fluo_CNN_torch_drive.ipynb` but with slight variations to architecture and training
3. `classify_fluo_CNN_3D_torch_drive.ipynb` - Pytorch implementation of CNN taking multiple 2D images in separate channels
4. `classify_fluo_CNN_3D_torch_drive_2.ipynb` - Same as `classify_fluo_CNN_3D_torch_drive.ipynb` but wit slight variations to architecture and training
